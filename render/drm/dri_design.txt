# Problem

Multiple DRI devices with multiple screens. Multiple polling of udev for hotplug events.

# Solution

* Runtime in the main thread.
* One main thread polling the card udev device looking for hotplug events of new cards.
* Each new card spawns a new thread. That thread polls the device for screen configure events.
* Should each device thread spawn a new thread for each screen? Is that possible? (egl seems to be per card)
* Each card (or screen) has it's own OpenGL context.
* Each thread with an OpenGL context has an inbound queue for data loading.
* Scenes are tied to a particular OpenGL thread context.
* Scenes can be shifted to different contexts.
